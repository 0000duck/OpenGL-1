This project introduces the third transformation: scaling. 
In order to scale an object in space we are going to implement the scaling matrix as follows:
		---							---   
		| Xscale	0		0	   0  |  
		|  0	  Yscale	0	   0  |  
		|  0		0	  Zscale   0  |
		|  0		0		0	   1  |
		---							--- 
Here are used the concepts of:
 - Transformation matrix
 - scaling
 - Vertex Shader
