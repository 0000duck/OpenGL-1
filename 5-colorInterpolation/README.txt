This project demonstrates the concept of interpolation applied by the rasterizer on the geometric visible data.
To demonstrate that, we assign at each vertex a color based on its position in the 3D space and we can see how the colors
shade while going from a vertex to another.
Everything we apply on a fragment will be affected by this effect, however for simplicity, here only color is used.

Here are used the concepts of:
 - Color
 - rasterizer interpolation
 - Fragment shader Shader
