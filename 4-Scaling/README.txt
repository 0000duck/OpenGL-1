This project introduces the third transformation: scaling. 
In order to scale an object in space we are going to implement the scaling matrix as follows:

	| Xscale	0		0	0  |  
	|  0		Yscale		0	0  |  
	|  0		0	  	Zscale  0  |
	|  0		0		0	1  |

Here are used the concepts of:
 - Transformation matrix
 - scaling
 - Vertex Shader
