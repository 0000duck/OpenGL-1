This project introduces the first transformation: translation. 
In order to translate an object in space we are going to implement the translation matrix as follows:

	|  1	0	0	Xshift  | 
	|  0	1	0	Yshift  | 
	|  0	0	1	Zshift  | 
	|  0	0	0	   1	| 


Here are used the concepts of:
 - Transformation matrix
 - Translation
 - Vertex Shader
